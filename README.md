# CS-2019

### GOAL : Algorithms to learn and excel in
> Sieve of Eratosthenes, or another prime number sieve
> Depth-first search
> Breadth-first search
> Dijkstra's algorithm
> Floyd--Warshall algorithm
> Either Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm
> Some implementation of topological sorting, such as by using DFS
> Convex hull (I recommend the Monotone Chains algorithm)
> Coordinate compression
> Edmonds--Karp, or another implementation of the Ford--Fulkerson method; or a preflow-push algorithm; or, if you are preparing an ACM codebook, Dinic's algorithm. (Note: Max flow is not allowed to appear on the IOI, but may nevertheless appear on national team-selection contests)
